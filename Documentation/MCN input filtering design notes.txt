Options for active filtering of analog inputs on MCN v2

1. Per-channel active filters
	- because of cost and board space concerns, anti-aliasing filter order is limited
	- seems practical to implement 2-order Butterworth (=24 op-amps, 6x TSSOP-16 packages)

2. External ADC
	- options:
		- TI ADS7953
			- 12-bit, 12- or 16-channel
			- has mux breakout for filtering

		- TI ADS1158
			- 16-bit
			- 16-channel
			- http://www.ti.com/product/ads1158
			- SPI interface
		
3. External mux
	- two 12-channel muxes: still use the C2000 internal mux, but switch a "nice" signal conditioning filter inline into the channel of interest
	- options:
		- TI CD4067B
