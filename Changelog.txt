Magic CAN Node - changelog

# v1.0.0 (r01)
(initial draft)

# v1.0.1 (r02) - 2014-02-10
- Fix incorrect drill size for X4.
- Add mating connectors and terminals as BOM entries in schematic (instead of manually adding later).
- Invert 12V switching to avoid glitch on processor startup
- Update TI component packages (IC5, IC6) to DBV package to match stocked components
- FIXME: Replace unsourceable ESD protection arrays IC7, IC2

VERSION NUMBERING UPDATE - November 2014
r02 is now v1.0.1.

# v.2.0 - 2014-12-04
- Redesign analog sensor input filter circuit to reflect new sensor measurement strategy:
	* Analog filter on each channel is an RC anti-aliasing filter with f_3dB = 5 kHz
	* Add option for differential-mode analog inputs (AINx to AIN-)
- Change 12V-3V3 power supply: use circuit from Battery Interface Module r02 (v.1.0.1) because TPS560200-based circuit from Magic CAN Node v.1.0.1 was unsourceable
- Remove ESD protection diode arrays
- Remove switched +12V output and associated circuit
- Change CAN connectors: remove AMPSEAL CAN connectors, replace with Micro-Fit 6pin
- Change JTAG header to 0.05" pitch
- Remove 'CAN_RESET' button
- Add '+3V3 OK' and '+12V OK' indicator LEDs

# v2.1 - 2015-03-23
- Replace CAN transceiver (ISO1050) with replacement (SN65HVD1050), for standardization
- Add 100k pulldowns to analog inputs.
- Tie VREFHI to +3V3 to enable ratiometric analog measurements.
